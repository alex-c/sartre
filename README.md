# Sartre

A minimal, authentic blogging platform. Composed of a .NET Core backend, a PostgreSQL database and a Vue frontend, Sartre allows you to run one or several simple, clean blogs with one or several users.

## Development Status

Sartre is in early development! The MVP will contain the following features:

- multi-blog platform: use Sartre to run a single or several blogs
- multi-user: several users can be contributors to a single blog
- guest authors: add users as guest authors for single post without giving them full contributor access to a blog
- full administration
- saving of drafts and publishing of posts
- only text posts: no images, syntax highlighting or rich text features
